# Image Loading Fix Summary

## Problem
Product images weren't loading correctly due to redirect loops between the frontend and backend.

## Solution
1. Updated the ProductImage component to use the backend's media-proxy endpoint directly
2. Added multiple fallbacks in case the primary method fails
3. Created an ImageDebug diagnostic tool to help identify image loading issues

## Files Modified
- src/components/ProductImage.jsx - Main fix to handle image URL management
- src/components/ImageDebug.jsx - New diagnostic tool
- src/App.jsx - Added a route for the image debug tool
- src/views/base/StoreHeader.jsx - Added a dev-only link to the image debug tool

## How It Works
1. The ProductImage component now uses the /media-proxy/ endpoint which avoids the redirect loop
2. If an image fails to load, multiple fallbacks are attempted in sequence
3. If all fallbacks fail, a placeholder image is shown

## Testing
The media-proxy endpoint was verified to work correctly with curl before implementation.
